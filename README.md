## VI Test

Using create-react-app or similar as a base - create a react Material UI
form component that inherits an array of form input props.
https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/

The types of inputs required for this reusable component are:
text
email
phone
postcode
select
checkbox

These inputs should have validation and you should also note in the
design the required fields \*.

Once the form is valid and the user hits submit, print out the JSON
object below the submit button.

You may use form validation libraries and other libraries at your choice
for this test.
